### Hello World!

#### I'm ***Pablo***, a self-taught programmer.
I'm based on Sweden 🇸🇪  
Originally from Spain :es:

**Work**   

I've been working in Arduino since 2019 where:  
 📝 I've worked on the content team as a technical writter.  
 🆘 At the moment on the Support team, working with the PRO family.  


**Some stuff that I do:**  

 🔨 PCB design  
 📙 Cpp libraries  


**Stuff that you will find on my GitHub**  

Mainly small projects that I'm working or I've worked on.  

Lately I'm focusing on Sourcemod plugins, which are small scripts to add features to game-servers running Valve's game-engine called Source engine, my plugins are mainly focused on Counter Strike.

***Main programming skills***
